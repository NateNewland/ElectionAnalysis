#The Purpose
In this module we were told Steve wanted help with analyzing the stocks from 2017 and 2018 and tto follow market trends.
The reason for this code is to show we can make a Macro in Excell that is easy to use and makes sense looking at.
Something eas to read and to understand play a key roll in how successful someone or a business can be.

##Results of Our Findings

In the year 2017 the stock market was in a better spot than 2018; With only one stock being in the red the rest saw an overall increase.
Only two stocksd in 2018 were in the green for the year. This can indicate to us selling at the end of the year in 2017 was the best way
to insure making a profit.

###Summary
By refactoring code we can show how effiecent and optimized our program is. However for the average using this information 
isn't too useful and can make the screen loud and seem distracting. In refactoring this script we throw in a timer.
This can slow it down and by displaying our time on the program we create a window that seems unnecessary to the average user.
